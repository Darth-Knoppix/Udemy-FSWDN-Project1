## What is it?
A static webpage generator using Python

## How do I run it?
In Terminal or CMD open `entertainment_center.py`

## How do I modify it?
In `entertainment_center.py` add movies to the list `movies`
To use the open movie database for the description and rating,
use `scrape_movie()`
which takes two arguments as strings, `name` of the movie and `youtube_url` e.g.
`scrape_movie("Star Wars", "vP_1T4ilm8M")`
